            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>I am Pavel. I am 19 years old. I was born in a small town Logoysk in Minsk Region and I still live here. 
                Also, I am third year student at BNTU. Recently I have decided the programming languages that are tought 
                at my university are not my cup of tea and I have felt that I would like to make something that a person 
                can see on display. So, I took up courses in "Stormnet" and I would not stop and wait till somebody would 
                offer me a job. I realize that my knowledge isn't enought now, that is why I am trying to improve it.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I am into volleyball and football. In addition to that I like billiards, table tennis, 
                I am into everything that has connection with sports. However I don't give up one selfeducation so I read 
                different sources of information to become more educated in front-end development. I was looking forward 
                to RS School courses in order to develop my programming skills. I'm absolutely sure that after successful 
                completion of the courses I would like to be hired by “EPAM”.</p>
            <p>My starting point in front-end was the longing for doing what I like, what is right for me.</p>
