### ABOUT ME

<p>I am Pavel. I am 19 years old. I was born in a small town Logoysk in Minsk Region and I still live here. Also, I am third year student at BNTU. 
Recently I have decided the programming languages that are tought at my university are not my cup of tea and I have felt that I would like to make something that a person can see on display. So, I took up courses in "Stormnet" and I would not stop and wait till somebody would offer me a job. I realize that my knowledge isn't enought now, that is why I am trying to improve it.
</p>
<p>
In my spare time I am into volleyball and football. In addition to that I like billiards, table tennis, I am into everything that has connection with sports. However I don't give up one selfeducation so I read different sources of information to become more educated in front-end development. I was looking forward to RS School courses in order to develop my programming skills.
I'm absolutely sure that after successful completion of the courses I would like to be hired by “EPAM”.
</p>
<p>My starting point in front-end was the longing for doing what I like, what is right for me.
